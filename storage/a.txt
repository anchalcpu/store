terating through a dictionary means, visiting each key-value pair in order. It means accessing a Python dictionary and traversing each key-value present in the dictionary. Iterating a dictionary is a very important task if you want to properly use a dictionary.

There are multiple ways to iterate through a dictionary, we are discussing some generally used methods for dictionary iteration in Python which are the following:

Iterate Python dictionary using build.keys() 
Iterate through all values using .values()
Looping through Python Dictionary using for loop
Iterate key-value pair using items()
Access key Using map() and dict.get
Access key in Python Using zip()
Access key Using Unpacking of Dict
